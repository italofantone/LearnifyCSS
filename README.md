We follow a clear and consistent style convention for defining and applying styles in our projects. This convention is based on the structure `property: value`, where `property` represents the CSS property you want to apply and `value` represents the specific value you want to assign to that property.

```css
.property-value {
    property: value;
}
```

To apply the italic font style, you can use the following convention.

```css
.font-style-italic {
    font-style: italic;
}
```

This means that by using the `.font-style-italic` class, the `font-style` property with the `italic` value will be applied to the selected element in your HTML.

By following this convention, you can define and apply a variety of styles in a clear and consistent manner across your projects.
